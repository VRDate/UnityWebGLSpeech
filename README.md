# Target

The `Unity WebGL Speech Package` is created for Unity version `5.3` or better and combines the `Unity WebGL Speech Detection` and `Unity WebGL Speech Synthesis ` packages.
This package was originally created for the `WebGL` platform and supports other platforms using a `Speech Proxy`.
This package requires a browser with the built-in [Web Speech API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html), like Chrome.
Detection requires an Internet connection.
The [browser compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API#Browser_compatibility) indicates which browsers have the `Speech API` implemented.
The [languages page](https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/languages) shows what languages are supported by the `Speech API`.
